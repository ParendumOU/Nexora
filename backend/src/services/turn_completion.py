"""Deterministic turn-completion decision (GitLab #213, Autonomy epic #238).

Centralizes — in code, not prompt prose — when an agent turn is *terminal*. The
old contract leaned on the model emitting a `<final/>` marker and a watchdog
re-poking turns that lacked it. The actual rule is simpler and structural:

    a turn is complete  ⇔  it emitted no tool calls this turn.

If the turn called tools, the orchestrator must resume with their results (not
complete). If it called none, it's a final answer (complete). The `<final/>`
marker is now just how that decision is *persisted* so the watchdog leaves a
finished turn alone — not the source of truth.

With native function calling (#214) this is fully reliable ("no tool_call = done").
With the legacy text-fence path the same rule holds, since `had_tool_calls`
already reflects a parsed fence. `is_turn_complete` is pure + unit-tested; the
turn engine calls it and persists the marker.
